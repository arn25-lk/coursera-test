    Function invocation is a new execution context
    Each execution context has:
        - Its own variable environment 
        - Special 'this' object
        - Refernce to its Outer Environment

    Referenced (not defined) variables will be searched for in its current scope fist. If not found, the Outer Reference will be searched,
    this will keep going until the global scope. If not found in global scope, variable takes value undefined.
